vim /etc/sudoers

Authentication using sudo has to be limited to 3 attempts in the event of an incorrect password.

Defaults	passwd_tries=num_tries

A custom message of your choice has to be displayed if an error due to a wrong
password occurs when using sudo.

Defaults	badpass_message="Message"

Each action using sudo has to be archived, both inputs and outputs. The log file
has to be saved in the /var/log/sudo/ folder

Defaults	logfile="logfilepath"
Defaults	log_input,log_output

The TTY mode has to be enabled for security reasons-

Defaults	requiretty

TTY	(teletype mode)
	command-line interface (CLI)
	allows user to interact with the operating system using text-based commands
	enabling requiretty makes it so that a user must be logged in to a TTY in order to use the "sudo" command
		this prevents users from running the sudo command over an insecure network connection or in scripts

For security reasons too, the paths that can be used by sudo must be restricted.
Example:
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin

Defaults	secure_path="those_path"

this already is default
