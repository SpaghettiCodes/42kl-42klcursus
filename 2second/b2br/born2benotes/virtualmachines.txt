what is a virtual machine:

virtual environment that works like a computer within a computer
runs on an isolated partition of its host computer with its own CPU, power, memory, operating system and otehr resources

How a virtual machine works:

emulate a whole computer and runs inside your physical computer
Works as a seperate independent machine, but runs as a process on your host operating system

Virtualization tech
	- simulate virtual hardware
	- physical machine are known as host while VM running on it are called guests
	- managed by software known as a hypervisor
		- responsible for managing and provisioning resources
		- schedules operation in VMs
			- does not overrun each other when using resources

		Types of hypervisors
			Type 1
				- bare metal hypervisors
				- installed natively on the underlying physical hardware
				- VM interact directly with hosts to allocate hardware resources (x extra software layers in between)
				- found in server based environment
				- Microsoft Hyper-Virtualization
				- seperate management tool needed to handle guest activities (creating new vm or managing permissions)

			Type 2 hypervisor
				- hosted hypervisors
				- runs on the host computer operating system
				- pass VM request to the host operating system, which then provisions the appopriate physical resources to each guest
				- slower than Type 1
					- each action have to go thru the host operating system
				- guest operating system are not tied to physical hardware
					- users can run VM and use their computer as usually
