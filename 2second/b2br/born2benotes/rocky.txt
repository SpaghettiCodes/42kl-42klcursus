ROCKY (successor to CENTOS)

Linux distribution develop by rocky enterprise software foundation 
A downstream, complete binary compatible release using the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) operating system source code

	Downstream
		- a direction away from the original authors or maintainers of softwar that is distrubuted as source code
	binary compatible release
		- runs the same machine executable code for a CPU
		- ability to run the same software without requiring the application to be recompiled
		- opposite of Source code compatibility
			- recompilation or interpretation is necessary before the program can run
	Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
		- commercial open source Linux distribution developed by RedHat for commercial market
	

KDUMP
	- A feature of Linux kernel that creates crash dump in the event of a kernal crash
			- crash dump
				- taking all information in RAM and writing into a storage drive
				- recorded state of the working memory of a computer program at a specific time
					- generally when the program crashed // terminal abnormally
				- other key pieces of program state are dumped at the same time
					- process registers
					- porgram counter
					- stack pointer
					- memory management information
					- other porcessor and operating system flags and information

				- snap dump (snapshot dump)
					- a memory dump requested by the computer operator or by the running program, after which the program can continue
					- assist in diagnosing and debugging
				
				- fatal exception automatically triggers a core dump

			- kernel crash (kernel panic) (BSOD)
				- computer error where the system os cannot easily recorver
				- safety measure taken by an os upon detecting an internal fatal error
					- fatal system error
						- operating system halts because it has reached a condition where it can no longer operate safely


	- Exports a memory image (vmcore) that can be analyzed for the purpose of debugging and determining cause of crash
	
	- Dumped image is exported as a Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) object
	
	- can be accessed through 
		- /proc/vmcore

	- can be saved to a 
		- locally accessible file system 
		- raw device
		- remote system over the network
