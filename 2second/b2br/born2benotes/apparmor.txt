AppArmor (Application Armor)

Linux kernel security module
- allows sys admin to restrict programs' capabilities with per-program profiles
	- profiles allow capabilities like network access, raw socket access, and the permission to read, write or execute files

	- supplements traditional Unix Discretionary access control (DAC) model by providing mandatory access control (MAC)
	
		DAC discretionary access control
			type of access control that restrict access to objects based on the identity of subjects and groups to which they belong
		MAC mandatory access control
			- method of limiting access to resources based on the sensitivity of the information and the authorization of the user to access information 
			- define sensitivity by means of security label
					- represents a level or hierarchical classification of the information
					- defines the category or group the information belongs

		proactively protects the operating system ad application from external or internal threats by enforcing a specific rule set on a per application basis
			- define what system resources individual application can access and with what privileges
		
		Every breach iof policy triggers a message in the system log
