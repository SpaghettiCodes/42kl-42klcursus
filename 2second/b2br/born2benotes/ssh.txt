SSH

Secure Shell Protocol

Network communication protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network
	application are remote login and command-line execution

communication between 2 computers is encrypted meaning it is suitable for use on insecure network
(cryptographic network protocol)

allows 2 computer to communicate (hypertext transfer protocol http) and share data

often used to perform operations on remote computers

Based on a client-server architecture
	- connecting an SSH client instance with an SSH server

Secure communication provides a strong password authentication and encrypted communication with a public key over an insecure channel

Protects the network from various attacks such as DNS spoofing, IP source routing and IP spoofing

Usage of SSH Protocol
- provides secure access to users and automated processes
- secure way to transfer files from one system to another over an insecure network
- issues remote commands to the users
- helps user manage the network infrastucture and critical system components
- log in to shell on a host and is used to execute a single command
- used for forwarding a port
- securely browse the web through the encrypted proxy connection 

How does it work
Connects to a secure shell client application with the SSH server
1. Client initiates the connection by contacting server
2. Server sends its public key
3. Client negotiatie parameter and open secure channel
4. User login to server host operating system

SSH - Keys

Public key - everyone can see it (encryption)
Private key - stays in computer and must be protected (decryption)

Key pairs
	User Key - public and private remain on user
	Host Key - public and privaate are on remote system
	Session Key - used when large amount of data is to be transmitted

SSH encryption methods
rsa, dsa, ed25519

How is a key generated
	- public keys from local computer are passed to the server which is to be accessed
	- server identifies if the public key is registered
	- server creates a new secret key and encrypts it with the public key 
	- encrypted code is sent to the local compueter
	- data is unlocked by the private key of the system and is sent to the server
	- server verifies with the local computer
	- ssh creates a route and all encrypted data arre transferred through it

Set up a ssh server using OpenSSH:
OpenSSH	connectivity tool for remote sign-in that uses SSH protocol
- encrypts all traffic between client and server to eliminate eavesdropping, connection hijacking

update package manager
1. sudo apt-get update

install ssh server
2. sudo apt install openssh-server

check ssh service 
3. sudo systemctl status ssh
OR sudo service ssh status

stop ssh server
4. sudo service ssh stop

start ssh server
5. sudo service ssh start

turn off ssh indefinitely
5. sudo systemctl disable ssh

Get server IP address:
ip a

Connecting to a Server Using SSH:

ssh Username@IPAddressOrHostname -p (specify port)

Change SSH configuration :
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sshd_config - server config file on Linux
ssh_config - client config file on UNix

to change the ssh default port
#Port 22 -> Port 4242

disable root login
#PermitRootLogin no -> PermitRootLogin no
- now you have to log in as a normal user and use su - to become a root user
