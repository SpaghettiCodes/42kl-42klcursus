From now on, all your classes must be designed in the Orthodox Canonical Form,
unless explicitely stated otherwise. Then, they will implement the four required member
functions below:

• Default constructor
• Copy constructor ClassName(ClassName &Class)
	- member function that initilaizes an object using another object of the same class
	- creates an object by initializing it with an object with same class
	- there is this thing called "Copy Elision"? gotta research on that..
• Copy assignment operator (that operator= thing? yeah that) ClassName & ClassName::operator=(class_name)
• Destructor

Split your class code into two files. The header file (.hpp/.h) contains the class
definition whereas the source file (.cpp) contains the implementation
