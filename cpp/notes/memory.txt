new and delete

new is basically malloc
delete is basically free

- new data-type

double *pvalue = new double; --> allocated memory

we dont use malloc because new constructs object (its a oop after all)

delete pvalue; --> free memory

- You can dynamically allocate memory for arrays using new

char *pvalue = NULL
pvalue = new char[20] --> 20 free space baby;

delete []pvalue; --> delete array pointed to by pvalue
double **pvalue = NULL 

- for multidimentional arrays
double **pvalue = NULL
pvalue = new double[4][1];

delete []pvalue; --> yep, same syntax

- Dynamically allocate memory for object (what)

class MyClass
{
	public:
		Box()
		{
			// constructor
		}
		~Box()
		{
			// destructor
		}
}

int main()
{
	MyClass *class;
	class = new MyClass[4] // will call constructor 4 times;

	delete []class // will call destructor 4 times;
}
