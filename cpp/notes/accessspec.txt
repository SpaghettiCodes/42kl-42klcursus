define how members of a class can be accessed

public - member can be accessed and modified from outside the code
private - member cant be accessed (or viewed) from outside the class
protected - members cannot be accessed from outside the class, but can be accessed in inherited classes

it is possible to access private members of a class using public method inside the same class (Encapsulation)

It is good practice to declare your data attribtues as private
	- reduce possiblity of youself to mess up the code (cough)

By default, everything is private if you dont specify an access specifier (except for the constructor)

public emembers are used to provide an interface for interacting with the class
private members are used to implement internal workings of the class

allows the class to be used by other code without exposing its implementation detail
