MMMM OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
MMMMMMMM

difference from c and c++

Procedural programming 
	writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data 
Object-oriented programming
	creating objects that contain both data and functions.

Adv
	faster and easier to execute
	provides clear structure 
	keep C++ code DRY (dont repeat yourself)
	create full reusable application with less code and shorter development time

Class - templete for objects
Object - instance of a class

When individual objects are created, they inherit all variables and functions from the class

- Attributes and methods

Methods -> functions
Attributes -> Variables

Class - user-defined data type that we can use in our program
		- work as an object constructor 
		- a blueprint for creating objects

class MyClass {       // The class
  public:             // Access specifier
    int myNum;        // Attribute (int variable)
    string myString;  // Attribute (string variable)
};

class - create a class
public - access specifier (u learn more ltr)
Variables declared in a class is attributes;

to access the class attributes, use the dot syntax (.)

static members in an object - shared with all other objects in the class
							- can be called even though there is no objects
static methods in an object - can access only static data members
							- cannot access non-static data members and not even call non-static members function
							- can be called even if no object of the class exist
