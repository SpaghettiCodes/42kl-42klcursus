cpp

i love object-oriented programming
okay maybe not really
idk

Compiling cpp files

g++ -o -Wall-Wextra-Werror -std=c++98 <name> <source files>

orthodox canonical form what the fuck is this -

A default construct
	Used to initialize ojbect and data members when no other value is available

A copy constructor 
	Implement call-by-value parameters

An assignment operator
	assign one value to another 

A destructor
	i guess you free that object you call this?

Write class names in UpperCamelCase format 
Files containing class code is named according to the class name (wtf)
