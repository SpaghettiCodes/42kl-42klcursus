Encapsulation

make sure sensitive data is hidden from users
allows the programmer to change one part of the code without affecting other parts

declare class variables/attributes as private
	to read or modify value of private member, provide public get and set methods

			class Employee {
			private:
				// Private attribute
				int salary;

			public:
				// Setter
				void setSalary(int s) {
				salary = s;
				}
				// Getter
				int getSalary() {
				return salary;
				}
			};

			int main() {
			Employee myObj;
			myObj.setSalary(50000);
			cout << myObj.getSalary();
			return 0;
			}

Access Private Members;
