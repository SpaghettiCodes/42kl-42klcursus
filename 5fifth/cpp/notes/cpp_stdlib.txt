You are allowed to use almost everything from the standard library. Thus, instead
of sticking to what you already know, it would be smart to use as much as possible
the C++-ish versions of the C functions you are used to.

• However, you can’t use any other external library. It means C++11 (and derived
forms) and Boost libraries are forbidden. The following functions are forbidden
too: *printf(), *alloc() and free(). If you use them, your grade will be 0 and
that’s it.

		string class for working with strings

		iostream library for input/output operations, such as reading from cin and writing to cout
		fstream library for working with files

		complex class for working with complex numbers
		random library for generating random numbers
